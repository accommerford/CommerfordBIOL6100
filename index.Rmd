Welcome to my website! 

My name is Audrey. I am currently a senior undergrad student at UVM studying Biological Science. I am a member of the UVM sailing team and spend most of my free time on the lake (when it isn't frozen). After graduation I am hoping to work in clinical research and maybe put some of my skills from this class to use.
